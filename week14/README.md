This week is dedicated to one-on-one meetings for finals. 

You are welcome to show up and quietly work in the classroom and I can answer questions if it's not pulling me away from the student with the meeting. 

Otherwise you have to just show up for your meeting. BUT BE ON TIME. There is no wiggle room.
